In this repository Self organized map a.k.a Kohonen network implemented as two classes: 
Nodes which have vector values in input space and indices of input data rows which they "own" and 
SOMNEtworks which consists of neuron-nodes to which datapoints are assigned in training.

plotsom.py includes utilities to create plots over dimension pairs of data and network neuron values

required libraries: numpy and matplotlib.pyplot for plots (written with versions 1.14.2 and 2.2.2 (matplotlib) respectively)
